<!-- ### Capstone Project: "Interactive Quiz Web App"

#### Overview
Students will create an interactive quiz web application that allows users to answer questions on a specific topic of their choice (e.g., science, history, pop culture). This project will integrate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, providing a fun way to learn frontend development.

#### Objectives
- Build a functional web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Utilize jQuery to enhance user experience with interactivity.
- Implement basic data management with JavaScript.
- Develop skills in designing user-friendly interfaces.

#### Project Components

1. **Homepage**
   - **Header**: Title of the quiz app and a start button.
   - **Instructions Section**: Brief description of how to play the quiz.
   - **Footer**: Author information and links to resources.

2. **Quiz Page**
   - **Question Display**: A section to show the current question.
   - **Answer Options**: Multiple-choice buttons for answers.
   - **Score Tracker**: Display current score and number of questions answered.
   - **Next Question Button**: A button to proceed to the next question.
   - **End Screen**: Display total score and options to restart the quiz or go back to the homepage.

3. **Question Data Management**
   - Use an array of objects to store questions, options, and correct answers.
   - Implement a function to randomly select questions from the array for each quiz session.

4. **Styling and User Experience**
   - Use CSS to create an engaging layout (colors, fonts, button styles).
   - Ensure the app is responsive to work well on mobile and desktop devices.

5. **Interactive Features**
   - Use jQuery for:
     - Showing/hiding elements (e.g., questions and scores).
     - Animations when transitioning between questions.
     - Validating and giving feedback on answers (correct or incorrect).

6. **Accessibility Considerations**
